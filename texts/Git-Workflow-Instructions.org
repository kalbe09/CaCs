* Introduction

This project is part of a group exercise.

I suppose that you went through the
[[https://oer.gitlab.io/oer-courses/cacs/Git-Introduction.html][Git Introduction]]
and installed and set up Git before you start here.

Please be aware that this is a new exercise, which we are going to
perform jointly for the first time, so there may be rough edges.
Please do not hesitate to ask early.  Your first steps with Git will
seem unfamiliar, but my goal is to help you in this unfamiliar
terrain.  Git is a powerful tool with many commands and options
(GitLab even more so), but the basic workflow should not be hard to
follow.  (As an aside: If you really go for Git, you probably want to
do that embedded in your daily work environment, where the most
important Git operations are available through some UI.  My daily work
environment is GNU Emacs with [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]].)

On our GitLab server, I will assign each of you as “Reporter” to my
project “{{{gitproject}}}”, and GitLab will notify you once that happened.
(This will take some time because our admins need to create your
accounts first, before I assign you manually …)
Then, you can start with this task, which is meant to practice the
[[https://oer.gitlab.io/oer-courses/cacs/Git-Introduction.html#slide-git-workflow][feature
branch workflow mentioned in the Git Introduction]].

In the following, M1, M2, … indicate different group members.

* Tasks

** Part 1
[[./gitlab-annotated.png]]

1. Determine group member M1 who forks project “{{{gitproject}}}”.
2. M1: Go to my project and perform the fork (see screenshot, which
   shows my browser’s upper right).  Default settings should be fine.

   In your fork, assign the remaining group members as Developers and
   me (my username is {{{gitusername}}}) as Guest or higher. (As
   Guest, I can open so-called Issues to offer feedback if necessary,
   but I can neither clone your fork nor see your branch.  That would
   be possible in other roles.)  To assign members in the fork, to the
   *left*, go to the project’s “Settings → Members” (/not/ part of
   screenshot), search members and assign roles.

   The newly added project members (including me) receive e-mails with
   the address of the forked project.
3. All: Check your notification settings (see screenshot, User
   settings → Notifications), where you can configure for what events
   to receive e-mails.  Maybe “Watch” your own project; at least, make
   sure that you are notified if I open an issue.

   Setup SSH keys (see
   [[https://oer.gitlab.io/oer-courses/cacs/Git-Introduction.html#slide-ssh][slide on SSH for pointers]]).

   Clone the fork to directory “{{{gitproject}}}”.  The necessary address
   (starting with ~@git~) is visible under the Clone button (see
   screenshot) under “Clone with SSH”.
5. M2: Create a new branch that collects your group work for this
   task, say “g42-task-1”.  Create a new sub-directory (under
   “{{{gitproject}}}”) for your group, e.g., “G42” if you are group G42.

   Please restrict all your group’s changes to that sub-directory.
   Add a first document (which will be shared via my project with the
   entire class subsequently, so, please, take some care), either a
   text file or some lightweight markup language; maybe start to
   document your experiences, questions, and answers.  Commit (maybe
   more than once) and push the branch.
6. M3: Pull and check out your branch, change the file more, commit,
   and push.
7. M4: Create a merge request in GitLab for your branch into my
   ~master~ branch.  (On the top of your fork’s project you should see
   a suggestion to create a merge request for your branch.  Maybe
   refresh the page.)

   When you create merge requests, please fill out the title
   (e.g., Group 42 - Task 1).  The description may remain empty here;
   in a real project you would explain what you propose to be merged.
   Note that the option “Delete source branch when merge request is
   accepted” is checked by default.  Maybe uncheck it to keep your
   branch.

** Part 2
After I merged your branch, my project is ahead of yours.  To bring
your project up-to-date (possibly including changes of other groups as
well), please do the following in your project (see
[[https://oer.gitlab.io/oer-courses/cacs/Git-Introduction.html#slide-git-remote][slide on “git remote”]]).

#+begin_src sh
git remote add upstream <the HTTP URL of original project>
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git rebase upstream/master
git push
#+end_src

During you work, you may see error messages, such as
~failed to push some refs~.  In particular, ~pull~ and ~push~ only
succeed if one project is strictly behind or ahead of the other.
Usually, Git provides some hints how you may proceed.

<<pull-rebase>>
One important command may be
~git pull --rebase~, which you can execute if additional commits
happened at the remote end as well as at yours.  In this situation,
~git push~ is rejected.  Try ~git pull --rebase~ first, then push
again.  Also, in this situation, ~git pull~ would offer to merge
changes, leading to an additional commit.  With option ~--rebase~,
however, remote commits are fetched, and your local commits are
re-executed on top of that (see
[[https://oer.gitlab.io/oer-courses/cacs/Git-Introduction.html#slide-git-rebase][slide on “git rebase”]]).
Afterwards, ~git push~ should succeed.  In general, for questions that
I have related to Git, Stack Overflow has answers.  You may want to
ask in a course-related forum, though.

We work on a playground project here, and it is unlikely that you
destroy things (well, ~git reset~ and options that “force” actions may
destroy state; you should not need them).  If your local repository
seems to be in an inconsistent state, you could just give that up and
clone again (depending on the amount of work that you did locally; you
can also copy files from the inconsistent state to a new clone).

Again, please do not hesitate to ask in a course-related forum.

* Further Suggestions

Create and resolve a conflict, to see what this is about: Two team
members, say Alice and Bob, pull their fork’s most recent state.  Both
edit the same file on the same branch simultaneously, commit, and try
to push.  Clearly, both commits are based on the same parent commit,
which implies that they are not nicely ordered.  Hence, one push
operation will be rejected, say Bob’s.

Given the rejected push, Bob could now ~git pull~
(don’t do that yet—read on), which is really ~fetch~ followed by
~merge~, ultimately creating a [[https://oer.gitlab.io/oer-courses/cacs/Git-Introduction.html#slide-git-merge][merge commit]].
Note that you see two branches on the slide, while you may believe to
work on one.  That belief would be wrong: You work on your local
branch, which you try to combine with a second remote branch.

To avoid the merge commit, Bob could
~git pull --rebase~ to rebase own commits on the current remote
state as suggested in the [[pull-rebase][previous section]].

In both cases (merge and rebase), Bob has to deal with the fact that
the same file was edited simultaneously at different places, maybe with
conflicting or even contradictory contents.  If such conflicts occur,
Git inserts so-called
[[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10657315/git-merge-left-head-marks-in-my-files][conflict markers]]
to highlight conflicting regions and tells as much on the command line,
with suggestions for follow-up commands.  It is up to Bob to decide
what to do with those regions.  Sometimes, Alice’s part may be better
than his, sometimes the other way round, sometimes both changes may
complement each other.  In any case, he produces a version in which
no conflict markers are left, commits, and pushes.

If Bob is lucky, his push succeeds.  If not, somebody, maybe Alice
again, was faster to commit and push in between, and Bob has to start
over.  This does not look like an effective workflow, does it?

So, in your team, you also may want to apply the Feature Branch
Workflow, where each team member works on an own branch (or really on
branches for specific purposes/features) to commit and push freely,
only to merge or rebase with the team’s main branch when stable states
have been reached.  In this case, it is a good practice to rebase the
individual branch on the most recent state of the team’s main branch
before merging.

Now, try the above?
