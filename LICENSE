This repository embeds different resources under different (free/libre
and open) license terms, aiming for REUSE best practices, see:
https://reuse.software/

REUSE practices are not fully respected.  If no license indicator is
given, CC BY-SA 4.0 (LICENSES/CC-BY-SA-4.0.txt) applies.

The subdirectory LICENSES contains license terms with their
identifiers.  Those identifiers may be included in source files to
clarify their license terms.  Alternatively, an additional file whose
name ends in ".license" may be present, which either points to a
license or embeds usage terms.
